How It Works
Bean Registration: The myService bean is registered in the AppConfig class.

Bean Retrieval:

The ApplicationContext.getBean(String name) method returns an Object.
Since the return type is generic, an explicit cast ((MyService) bean) is required to convert it to the desired type.
Cast Expression: The MyService bean is explicitly cast from Object to MyService before calling its performTask() method.

When to Use Cast Expressions in Spring
Generic Retrieval:
When retrieving beans from the ApplicationContext using generic methods like getBean(String name), which return an Object.

Working with Collections:
When dealing with generic collections of Spring-managed beans, such as retrieving beans by type or annotation.

Dynamic Proxies:
In cases where Spring creates dynamic proxy objects (e.g., for AOP or transactions), you may need to cast them to the
appropriate interface.

Alternative Without Cast (Type-Safe Retrieval)
Instead of casting, you can directly retrieve the bean with a type-safe method:

java
Copy code
MyService myService = context.getBean(MyService.class);
myService.performTask();
While the above approach is preferable for type safety, using a cast expression may still be necessary in
scenarios involving reflection, dynamic bean retrieval, or working with raw Object types.

Key Concepts Demonstrated
Numeric Cast:
Numeric values are cast from one primitive type to another (e.g., int to double or float to int). Spring's bean lifecycle
demonstrates this through @Bean methods.

Reference Cast:
Beans of a parent type are cast to a child type using instanceof to check compatibility before the cast. This avoids
runtime ClassCastException.

Lambda Cast:
Lambdas are explicitly cast to functional interfaces or intersection types, ensuring the correct target type is applied.

Intersection Types:
A lambda is cast to an intersection type to satisfy multiple interfaces, like MyFunctionalInterface and Serializable.
