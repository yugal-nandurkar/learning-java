Explanation
Safe Approach
Immutable Collections:

By converting the list to an immutable one, we prevent changes to its state during parallel processing.
Even if a lambda operates on the list elements, the list itself cannot be modified.
Thread-Safety:

Each lambda uses the immutable number variable, ensuring no shared mutable state.
Unsafe Approach
Shared Mutable State:

The total array is mutable, and each thread increments its first element, leading to race conditions or
unexpected mutations.
Potential Issues:

The output might vary based on the thread scheduling and execution order, breaking thread safety.
Output
When you run the application, you will see:

Safe Execution:

plaintext
Copy code
Running safe task execution:
Processing number: 1
Processing number: 2
Processing number: 3
Processing number: 4
Processing number: 5
All tasks submitted.
Unsafe Execution:

plaintext
Copy code
Running unsafe task execution:
Total incremented to: 1
Total incremented to: 2
Total incremented to: 3
Total incremented to: 4
Total incremented to: 5
All unsafe tasks submitted.
(Note: In the unsafe example, the order of increments might vary depending on thread execution timing.)

Key Points
Immutable Objects: Always prefer using immutable objects in lambdas to avoid unintended side effects.
Effectively Final: While lambdas enforce the "effectively final" rule for variables, mutable objects can still lead
 to changes in state.
Thread Safety: In parallel execution, shared mutable state can result in race conditions, leading to incorrect or
unexpected outcomes.
By following these principles, you can write clean, safe, and predictable code in Spring applications that leverages
lambdas effectively.
