Key Points
Conciseness and readability: The code is verbose and includes repetitive structures.
Reusability: Methods and structures are specific and not generalized for reuse.
Testability and maintainability: No abstractions or modular design to make testing or maintenance easier.
Concurrency: Operations on the account list are not thread-safe.
Parallelism and database-like operations: No use of streams or advanced collections to enable such features.
Performance: Uses basic loops and structures without performance considerations.
