The Nashorn JavaScript Engine is a JavaScript runtime that was introduced in Java 8 as a part of the Java Platform,
 Standard Edition (JDK). It allows you to run JavaScript code within Java applications. Nashorn is based on the
 invokedynamic feature introduced in Java 7 and is designed to replace the older Rhino engine. Here are the key
 functionalities of the Nashorn JavaScript engine:

Key Functionalities of Nashorn:
Embedding JavaScript in Java Applications:

Allows Java applications to embed and execute JavaScript code at runtime.
You can create and manipulate JavaScript objects from within Java, and vice versa.
JavaScript Execution:

Executes JavaScript code directly within the Java environment.
Supports running JavaScript code through Java’s ScriptEngine API (javax.script.ScriptEngine).
Can execute JavaScript code dynamically using eval() or exec().
Accessing Java from JavaScript:

Java classes, methods, and objects can be accessed and manipulated directly from JavaScript.
Nashorn allows JavaScript to instantiate Java classes and call Java methods.
Accessing JavaScript from Java:

Java code can interact with JavaScript objects, variables, and functions.
JavaScript objects can be treated as Java objects, which can be passed around and manipulated.
Performance Improvements:

Nashorn is more performant than Rhino due to its use of the invokedynamic mechanism in Java, which dynamically optimizes
 calls between JavaScript and Java.
It compiles JavaScript into Java bytecode at runtime, making execution faster.
JavaScript Engines and ScriptContexts:

Nashorn integrates with the javax.script API to provide a scripting engine for JavaScript. This allows you to evaluate
scripts, create bindings for JavaScript variables, and interact with Java objects within the script context.
The ScriptEngine provides methods like eval(), put(), get(), and createBindings() for managing the execution context.
Support for ECMAScript 5.1 and ECMAScript 6:

Nashorn supports ECMAScript 5.1 and partially supports ECMAScript 6 (ES6).
Features like let, const, and arrow functions are supported in Nashorn, though there may be certain limitations or
performance issues with some ES6 features.
Interfacing with Java Collections:

Java collections can be used and manipulated directly in JavaScript through Nashorn, allowing seamless integration between
Java and JavaScript collections.
Scripting API Integration:

You can use the ScriptEngineManager to create a Nashorn engine and execute JavaScript code, or integrate with Java's
scripting infrastructure for various use cases.
The engine supports standard methods like eval(), exec(), and evalScript() to evaluate JavaScript expressions.
JS to JavaScript Object Conversion:

Nashorn can automatically convert between JavaScript objects and Java objects, which enables smoother interoperation
between Java and JavaScript.
Use of Java 8 Lambda and Streams:

Nashorn is capable of calling Java 8 lambda expressions and Streams from JavaScript, allowing JavaScript to work with
modern Java features.
Compile JavaScript to Java Bytecode:

Nashorn compiles JavaScript code to Java bytecode ahead of time, making it run faster and be more efficient than
interpreting JavaScript at runtime like previous engines.
Example Use of Nashorn in Java:
java
Copy code
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class NashornExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        // Create a Nashorn script engine
        ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");

        // JavaScript code to be executed
        String script = "var greeting = 'Hello, ' + name; greeting;";

        // Create a binding and pass a Java variable to JavaScript
        engine.put("name", "World");

        // Evaluate the JavaScript
        Object result = engine.eval(script);

        // Output the result of JavaScript execution
        System.out.println(result);  // Outputs: Hello, World
    }
}
Deprecation of Nashorn:
As of JDK 11, Nashorn has been deprecated for future removal. This is due to the rise of other JavaScript engines
like GraalVM and better integration with external engines like Node.js. For new projects, it's recommended to explore
 GraalVM or other more modern JavaScript engines for Java integration.

In Summary, Nashorn Provides:
Seamless integration between Java and JavaScript.
Improved performance over previous engines.
Execution of JavaScript code from Java applications.
Interoperability between Java and JavaScript objects.
Access to ECMAScript 5.1 and some ES6 features.
Deprecation in JDK 11, with a recommendation to use alternatives like GraalVM for future development.

Let’s explore how Nashorn can be applied in the context of a Post Office system, demonstrating its key functionalities:

1. Embedding JavaScript in Java Applications
In a Post Office system, you may want to execute custom processing logic (e.g., dynamic pricing calculations or
custom handling for delivery options) using JavaScript at runtime. Nashorn allows you to embed and execute JavaScript
dynamically within a Java application.

Example:
java
Copy code
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class PostOffice {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        // Create Nashorn script engine
        ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");

        // JavaScript code to calculate delivery cost based on weight
        String script = "var cost = weight * rate; cost;";

        // Define variables for the script
        engine.put("weight", 5.0); // weight in kilograms
        engine.put("rate", 2.5);   // rate per kilogram

        // Execute script and calculate cost
        Object result = engine.eval(script);

        // Output the result
        System.out.println("Delivery cost: " + result); // Delivery cost: 12.5
    }
}
In this example, we dynamically calculate the delivery cost using JavaScript logic embedded in the Java application.

2. JavaScript Execution
Nashorn allows running JavaScript code directly within Java. For instance, a Post Office system might have a
Java backend that allows users to submit delivery tracking information, which could be dynamically processed
using JavaScript.

Example of Running JavaScript Dynamically:
java
Copy code
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class PostOffice {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        // Create Nashorn script engine
        ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");

        // Dynamic JavaScript code for changing delivery status
        String script = "function updateStatus(status) { return 'Delivery is ' + status; } updateStatus('Shipped');";

        // Execute JavaScript code
        Object result = engine.eval(script);

        // Output the result
        System.out.println(result); // Delivery is Shipped
    }
}
Here, we are dynamically executing JavaScript that updates the delivery status for a package.

3. Accessing Java from JavaScript
Java classes, methods, and objects can be accessed and manipulated directly from JavaScript using Nashorn.
For example, we can allow JavaScript code to instantiate a Java Package class and access its properties.

Example:
java
Copy code
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class Package {
    private String recipient;
    private double weight;

    public Package(String recipient, double weight) {
        this.recipient = recipient;
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public String getRecipient() {
        return recipient;
    }

    public double getWeight() {
        return weight;
    }
}

public class PostOffice {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        // Create Nashorn engine
        ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");

        // Pass Java object to JavaScript
        Package package = new Package("John Doe", 3.5);
        engine.put("package", package);

        // JavaScript accessing the Java object
        String script = "package.getRecipient() + ' has a package weighing ' + package.getWeight() + 'kg';";
        Object result = engine.eval(script);

        System.out.println(result); // John Doe has a package weighing 3.5kg
    }
}
In this case, JavaScript interacts with a Java object (Package) to access its properties.

4. Accessing JavaScript from Java
Nashorn allows Java code to interact with JavaScript objects, variables, and functions. For example, you can call a
JavaScript function from your Java code and pass Java variables to it.

Example:
java
Copy code
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class PostOffice {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        // Create Nashorn script engine
        ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");

        // JavaScript function to calculate delivery time based on distance
        String script = "function calculateTime(distance) { return distance / 60; }";

        // Execute the JavaScript function
        engine.eval(script);

        // Call the JavaScript function from Java
        Object result = engine.eval("calculateTime(180)");

        System.out.println("Delivery time: " + result + " hours"); // Delivery time: 3.0 hours
    }
}
Here, we define a JavaScript function (calculateTime) in Java, which is then called from Java to calculate the delivery
 time based on distance.

5. Performance Improvements
Nashorn is designed for better performance compared to the older Rhino engine. It compiles JavaScript code into
 Java bytecode at runtime, which improves execution speed. This is particularly useful in performance-sensitive
 applications such as real-time tracking in a Post Office system.

For example, complex delivery processing logic in a Post Office system can be executed faster because Nashorn optimizes
dynamic JavaScript code calls.

6. Interfacing with Java Collections
You can seamlessly interact with Java collections (e.g., lists, maps) from JavaScript using Nashorn. This allows you to
manipulate and process large amounts of delivery data dynamically.

Example:
java
Copy code
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class PostOffice {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        // Create Nashorn script engine
        ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");

        // Define a Java list in Java
        List<String> deliveries = Arrays.asList("Package 1", "Package 2", "Package 3");

        // Pass the Java list to JavaScript
        engine.put("deliveries", deliveries);

        // JavaScript to iterate over the list and print delivery names
        String script = "deliveries.forEach(function(delivery) { print(delivery); });";
        engine.eval(script);
    }
}
In this case, Nashorn enables the manipulation of a Java List in JavaScript.

7. Compile JavaScript to Java Bytecode
Nashorn compiles JavaScript code to Java bytecode, which makes execution faster. This is beneficial in a Post Office
system where real-time processing of packages and tracking information may require efficient script execution.

For example, complex sorting or filtering algorithms written in JavaScript for processing large delivery records can be
 compiled for faster execution within
 the Java environment.

Summary of Functionalities in a Post Office Context:
Embedding JavaScript in Java: Execute delivery-related calculations or dynamic business logic directly within
the Post Office system.
JavaScript Execution: Dynamically process status updates or delivery routes in real-time.
Accessing Java from JavaScript: JavaScript can access and manipulate Java objects, such as package details or delivery
 status.
Accessing JavaScript from Java: Java can call JavaScript functions, for example, to calculate delivery costs or time.
Performance Improvements: Nashorn’s optimized execution can be used for fast and efficient package tracking or order
processing.
Interfacing with Java Collections: Dynamically process collections of delivery records or customers using JavaScript.
Compile JavaScript to Bytecode: Run more efficient code for time-sensitive applications like real-time delivery tracking.
Nashorn enables dynamic JavaScript-based customization, improving flexibility, performance, and functionality within Java
 applications, like a Post Office system.
